# grep-from-yaml-config

Grep key from yaml and find usage in the project. 

Ever find it boring to cleanup config yaml file?

When your project runs OK, you don't really care about the config. Sometimes old config is not maintained and it's better to clean it up

## How to
- modify .env file
- then go run main.go
